            Hello guys, welcome to my blog, let&apos;s start.<br><br>What&apos;s the correct point of view from which I should define myself?<br>What is a good starting question to define something as complex as a human being?<br><br>I have struggled a lot in the past to find answers to these questions, and one day, some time ago, I came across a psychology speech. I think Professor Brian Little, in his TedTalk, has a point.<br><br>The point I am referring to is explained by the quote: "Don't ask people how they are, ask them what their project for life is." It may seem like a trivial concept, but is it really that simple?<br><br>Professor also explains that what defines us are certain common traits like introversion or extroversion, but those are characteristics that could define both us and other people.
