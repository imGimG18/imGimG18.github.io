                Honestly, I find it particularly difficult to write this introductory post. 
                Thinking about how to begin, I ask myself many questions: 
                <q>What is the correct point of view from which I should define myself? 
                How is it possible to define something as complex as a human being?</q> 
                I’ve struggled in the past to find answers to these questions.
            </p>

            <p>
                One day, some years ago, I came across a psychology speech, and I think Professor Brian Little has a point.
            </p>

            <blockquote cite="#">
                <p>“Don’t ask people who they are, ask them what their project for life is.”</p>
            </blockquote>

            <p>
                It may seem like a trivial concept, but is it really that simple?
            </p>

            <p>
                In his speech, Dr. Little explains that what defines us are certain common traits, 
                such as introversion or extroversion. However, these characteristics could define both us and other people. 
                What defines us uniquely as human beings? Ask yourself that question.
            </p>

            <p>
                According to Professor Little (and I see why he thinks that), a good answer might be this: 
                what defines us is what we choose as the meaning of our life — our projects, 
                the things that take us outside of our usual selves, beyond our comfort zone.
            </p>

            <p>
                So, who am I? This has not been a constant throughout my life, and surely it will change again. 
                But one thing is certain: I have always wanted to open a blog, write, and spark my creativity. 
                So, now... here I am.
