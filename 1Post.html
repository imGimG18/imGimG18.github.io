            <p>
                Honestly I find it particularly difficult to write this introductory post.
            </p>

            <p>
                Thinking about how to begin I ask myself a lot of questions: 
                “What is the correct point of view from wich I should define myself? 
                How is it possible to define something as complex as a human being?”. 
                I’ve struggled in the past to find answers to this questions.
            </p>

            <p>
                One day, some years ago, I came across a psychology speech and I think Professor Brian Little has a point.
            </p>

            <p>
                The point I am referring to is explained by the quote: 
                “Don’t ask people who they are, ask them what their project for life is.” 
                It may seem like a trivial concept, but is it really that simple?
            </p>

            <p>
                In his speech Dr. Little also explains that what defines us are certain common traits like introversion or extroversion, 
                but those are characteristics that could define both us and other people. 
                What defines us uniquely as human beings? Ask yourself that question.
            </p>

            <p>
                According to professor Little (and I see why he think that) a good answer to that question might be: 
                what defines us is what we choose as the meaning of our life, our projects, 
                the things that take us outside of our usual selves, outside of our comfort zone.
            </p>

            <p>
                So, who am I? This has not been a constant thing throughout my life, 
                and surely it will change again, but one thing is certain: 
                I have always wanted to open a blog, write, and spark my creativity. 
                So, now. Here I am...
